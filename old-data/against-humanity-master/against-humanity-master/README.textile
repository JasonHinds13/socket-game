h2. Plain Text Cards Against Humanity

This repository contains plain text files of the question and answer cards for Cards Against Humanity.
The repository also contains a json file representing all cards, and a ruby script to split the json files
into @question.txt@ and @answers.txt@.

Wouldn't it be nice to use these text files to seed a database?
